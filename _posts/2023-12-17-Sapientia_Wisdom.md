### Day 1 Antiphon

O Wisdom of our God Most High,<br>
guiding creation with power and love:<br>
come to teach us the path of knowledge!<br>

### Traditional

O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching from end to end, mightily and sweetly ordering all things: come and teach us the way of prudence.

### Latin: O Sapientia

O Sapientia, quae ex ore Altissimi prodiisti, attingens a fine usque ad finem, fortiter suaviterque disponens omnia: veni ad docendum nos viam prudentiae.

### Hymn

O come, thou Wisdom from on high, <br>
Who orders all things mightily; <br>
To us the path of knowledge show, <br>
And teach us in her ways to go. <br>
<p>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel <br>
Shall come to thee, O Israel! <br>

### Isaiah 11:2-3

The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him:<br>
a spirit of wisdom and of understanding,<br>
A spirit of counsel and of strength,<br>
a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD,<br>
and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD.<br>

### Sirach 24:1-3

Wisdom sings her own praises,<br>
among her own people she proclaims her glory.<br>
In the assembly of the Most High she opens her mouth,<br>
in the presence of his host she tells of her glory:<br>
"From the mouth of the Most High I came forth,<br>
and covered the earth like a mist."<br>

### Wisdom 8:1

Indeed, she spans the world from end to end mightily<br>
and governs all things well.<br>
