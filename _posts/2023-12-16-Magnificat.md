<p>
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, <br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, <br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. <br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: <br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, <br>
and holy is his Name. <br>
He has mercy on those who fear him  <br>
in every generation. <br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, <br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit. <br>
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, <br>
and has lifted up the lowly. <br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, <br>
and the rich he has sent away empty. <br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel <br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy, <br>
the promise he made to our fathers, <br>
to Abraham and his children forever. <br>
<p>
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, <br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen. <br>
