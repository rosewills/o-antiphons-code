### Day 2 Antiphon

O Leader of the House of Israel,<br>
giver of the Law to Moses on Sinai:<br>
come to rescue us with your mighty power!<br>

### Traditional

O Adonai and Leader of the House of Israel, who appeared to Moses in the flames of the burning bush and gave him the law on Sinai: come and redeem us with outstretched arm.

### Latin: O Adonai

O Adonai, et Dux domus Israel, qui Moysi in igne flammae rubi apparuisti, et ei in Sina legem dedisti: veni ad redimendum nos in brachio extento.

### Hymn

O come, O come, great Lord of might, <br>
Who to thy tribes on Sinai's height <br>
In ancient times once gave the law  <br>
In cloud and majesty and awe.       <br>
<p>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel <br>
Shall come to thee, O Israel! <br>
