### Day 4 Antiphon

O Key of David, <br>
opening the gates of God's eternal Kingdom: <br>
come and free the prisoners of darkness! <br>

### Traditional

O Key of David and scepter of the house of Israel; who open and none can shut; who shut and none can open: come and lead to freedom the prisoner who sits in darkness and the shadow of death.

### Latin: O Clavis David

O Clavis David, et sceptrum domus Israel; qui aperis, et nemo claudit; claudis, et nemo aperit: veni, et educ vinctum de domo carceris, sedentem in tenebris, et umbra mortis.

### Hymn

O come, O Key of David, come, <br>
And open wide our heav'nly home; <br>
Make safe the way that leads on high, <br>
And close the path to misery. <br>
<p>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel <br>
Shall come to you, O Israel. <br>

I will place the key of the House of David on his shoulder;<br>
what he opens, no one will shut,<br>
what he shuts, no one will open.<br>

### Revelation 3:7-8

"The holy one, the true,<br>
who holds the key of David,<br>
who opens and no one shall close,<br>
who closes and no one shall open,<br>
says this:<br>
'I know your works (behold, I have left an open door before you, which no one can close).'"<br>

### Psalm 27:4

One thing I ask of the LORD;<br>
this I seek:<br>
To dwell in the LORD's house<br>
all the days of my life,<br>
To gaze on the LORD's beauty,<br>
to visit his temple.<br>
