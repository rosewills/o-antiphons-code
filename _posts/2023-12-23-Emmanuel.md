### Day 7 Antiphon

O Emmanuel, our King and Giver of Law:<br>
come to save us, Lord our God!

### Traditional

O Emmanuel, our King and Lawgiver, the hope of all nations and their Savior: come and save us, O Lord our God!

### Latin: O Emmanuel

O Emmanuel, Rex et legifer noster, exspectatio gentium, et Salvator earum: veni ad salvandum nos Domine Deus noster.

### Good News

Take the first letter of each of the Latin titles of the Messiah for each antiphon in reverse chronological order:

**E**mmanuel\
**R**ex\
**O**riens

**C**lavis\
**R**adix\
**A**donai\
**S**apientia

It spells **ERO CRAS** which in Latin means *"Tomorrow I will come."*

### Hymn (Instrumental)

O come, O come, Emmanuel, <br>
And ransom captive Israel, <br>
That mourns in lonely exile here <br>
Until the Son of God appear. <br>
<p>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel <br>
Shall come to you, O Israel. <br>
