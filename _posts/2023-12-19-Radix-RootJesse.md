### Day 3 Antiphon

O Root of Jesse's stem, <br>
sign of God's love for all his people: <br>
come to save us without delay! <br>

### Traditional

O Root of Jesse, who stand as a sign among the people, before whom kings shall shut their mouths, to whom the nations shall make supplication: come to deliver us, and tarry not.

Another translation ...
O Flower of Jesse's stem, you have been raised up as a sign for all peoples; kings stand silent in your presence; the nations bow down in worship before you. Come, let nothing keep you from coming to our aid.

### Latin: O Radix Jesse

O Radix Jesse, qui stas in signum populorum, super quem continebunt reges os suum, quem Gentes deprecabuntur: veni ad liberandum nos, jam noli tardare.

### Hymn

O come, thou Rod of Jesse's stem, <br>
From every foe deliver them <br>
That trust thy mighty pow'r to save, <br>
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave. <br>
<p>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel <br>
Shall come to thee, O Israel! <br>
