### Day 5 Antiphon

O Radiant Dawn, <br>
splendor of eternal light, sun of justice: <br>
come and shine on those who dwell in darkness and in the <br>
shadow of death.

### Traditional

O Rising Dawn, splendor of eternal Light and Sun of Justice: come and illuminate those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death.

### Latin: O Oriens

O Oriens, splendor lucis eterne, et sol justitia: veni, et illumina sedentes in tenebris, et umbra mortis.

### Hymn

O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer<br>
Our spirits by thine advent here;<br>
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,<br>
And death's dark shadows put to flight.<br>
<p>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel <br>
Shall come to you, O Israel. <br>

### Isaiah 9:1-2

The people who walked in darkness <br>

have seen a great light; <br>

Upon those who lived in a land of gloom <br>

a light has shone. <br>

You have brought them abundant joy <br>

and great rejoicing. <br>

### John 1:5

The light shines in the darkness, <br>

and the darkness has not overcome it. <br>


### Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:78-79)

In the tender mercy of our God <br>

the dawn from on high shall break upon us, <br>

to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, <br>

to guide our feet into the way of peace. <br>

### Psalm 23:4

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, <br>

I will fear no evil, for you are with me; <br>

your rod and your staff comfort me. <br>

### Malachi 3:20

But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Justice <br>

will arise with healing in its wings; <br>

And you will go out leaping like calves from the stall. <br>


### Creator of the Stars of Night

Come in your holy might, we pray, <br>

Redeem us for eternal day; <br>

Defend us while we dwell below <br>

From all assaults of our dread foe. <br>
