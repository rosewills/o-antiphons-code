# O Antiphons

This is a daily devotional webpage featuring the O Antiphons - short prayers traditionally prayed on the evenings of the week leading up to Christmas (Dec. 17-23). They are typically set to music, and you may recognize them as lyrics from the Advent hymn "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel." Dating back to the 6th century, today O Antiphons are prayed and sung in various forms across all Christian denominations.

This is a blog-style site, with one devotional posted per day during the week leading up to Christmas.
