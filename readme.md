# O Antiphons (Advent 2023)

This is a daily devotional webpage featuring the O Antiphons: short prayers traditionally prayed on the evenings of the week leading up to Christmas (Dec. 17-23). They are typically set to music; you may recognize them as lyrics from the Advent hymn "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel." 

The O Antiphons date back to the 6th century, and today they are prayed and sung in various forms across all Christian denominations.

This site is organized in a blog format, with one devotional posted per day during the week leading up to Christmas.
