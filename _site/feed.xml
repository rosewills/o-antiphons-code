        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/O_Sapientia.png&quot; class=&quot;drawing&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-antiphon&quot;&gt;Day 1 Antiphon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Wisdom of our God Most High,&lt;br /&gt;
guiding creation with power and love:&lt;br /&gt;
come to teach us the path of knowledge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;traditional&quot;&gt;Traditional&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching from end to end, mightily and sweetly ordering all things: come and teach us the way of prudence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latin-o-sapientia&quot;&gt;Latin: O Sapientia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Sapientia, quae ex ore Altissimi prodiisti, attingens a fine usque ad finem, fortiter suaviterque disponens omnia: veni ad docendum nos viam prudentiae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hymn&quot;&gt;Hymn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O come, thou Wisdom from on high, &lt;br /&gt;
Who orders all things mightily; &lt;br /&gt;
To us the path of knowledge show, &lt;br /&gt;
And teach us in her ways to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel &lt;br /&gt;
Shall come to thee, O Israel! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

      &lt;h3 id=&quot;isaiah-112-3&quot;&gt;Isaiah 11:2-3&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him:&lt;br /&gt;
a spirit of wisdom and of understanding,&lt;br /&gt;
A spirit of counsel and of strength,&lt;br /&gt;
a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD,&lt;br /&gt;
and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3 id=&quot;sirach-241-3&quot;&gt;Sirach 24:1-3&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Wisdom sings her own praises,&lt;br /&gt;
among her own people she proclaims her glory.&lt;br /&gt;
In the assembly of the Most High she opens her mouth,&lt;br /&gt;
in the presence of his host she tells of her glory:&lt;br /&gt;
“From the mouth of the Most High I came forth,&lt;br /&gt;
and covered the earth like a mist.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3 id=&quot;wisdom-81&quot;&gt;Wisdom 8:1&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Indeed, she spans the world from end to end mightily&lt;br /&gt;
and governs all things well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Magnificat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mary-magnificat.jpg&quot; class=&quot;drawing&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, &lt;br /&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, &lt;br /&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. &lt;br /&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: &lt;br /&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, &lt;br /&gt;
and holy is his Name. &lt;br /&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him  &lt;br /&gt;
in every generation. &lt;br /&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, &lt;br /&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit. &lt;br /&gt;
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, &lt;br /&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly. &lt;br /&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, &lt;br /&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty. &lt;br /&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel &lt;br /&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy, &lt;br /&gt;
the promise he made to our fathers, &lt;br /&gt;
to Abraham and his children forever. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, &lt;br /&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
