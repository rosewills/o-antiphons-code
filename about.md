*Close to Home* is a resource website for college students recovering from a traumatic loss. It is not specifically about grief or trauma, nor how to be successful in college, but about each in the context of the other: navigating your education while dealing with something that eclipses it.

I thought it might be helpful to collect resources focusing on the unique ways grief and trauma affect students, so they might be easier to locate.

Additionally, since being a grieving student can be extremely isolating - there simply aren't many convenient contexts to discuss it - I hope *Close to Home* can create one of those contexts.

If you find yourself on this page because you've lost someone you love, I hope you'll find some encouragement and validation here. Please know that the impact of your circumstances is real, the weight you carry is significant, and you deserve all the support you can get.

The upshot of this blog, in a nutshell:
- Your health is your highest priority.
- You shouldn't have to sacrifice your hopes for the future to maintain that priority.
<br />
- Grief and trauma alter how you engage with academics.
- Recovery takes time, and deserves space.
<br />
- It's okay to be limited by something outside your control.
- Life during recovery isn't going to be perfect. This is not your fault.
<br />
- You are the expert in your own healing.
- This site is just for support, not for advice.

#### What this site is not
You could probably fill hundreds of different blogs with all the areas of life a loss might touch. This site focuses on just one of them.

So if you have just lost a loved one and have not yet even begun to consider school, this site probably won't be helpful to you at the moment. Take your time, and come back when you're ready..

<aside>Also (in case it isn't immediately obvious), this site is not a "substitute for professional help."</aside>
